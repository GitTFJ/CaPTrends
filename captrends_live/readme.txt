Description

CaPTrends Live is the ‘living’ version of the database, where new trend records will be added over time.

The protocol for expanding the CaPTrends dataset into 'CaPTrends Live' is in development, and so CaPTrends Live is not currently available. This protocol will be released in December 2022, with the intention of CaPTrends Live becoming active in late 2023

If anyone is interested in engaging with the curation, development or maintainence of CaPTrends Live, please contact thomas.frederick.johnson(at)outlook.com
